### Guy Fawkes

*1570 – 1606*

Guy Fawkes was one of many recusants in England in the 16th and 17th centuries. A staunch defender of the Catholic religion, he faced persecution after the establishment of the Anglican Church during the Protestant Reformation.

Unlike other recusants, Guy Fawkes, along with other provincial Catholics, took the fight for Catholicism to the extreme. His commitment made him the driving force behind the "Gunpowder Plot," an intricate two-year plot to eliminate King James I and much of the Protestant aristocracy. This elite had relegated the religion of Catesby and Fawkes to a minority and persecuted position.

In 1605, the conspiratorial group grew to 13 members with a seemingly simple goal: to rent space under Parliament to gradually store gunpowder until it accumulated 36 barrels. The plan was to detonate it when Parliament met, eliminating those who permitted Catholic repression. However, a letter warned a Catholic parliamentarian days before the opening, arousing suspicion. As a precaution, on November 4, 1605, the eve of the opening of Parliament, a raid was carried out that discovered Guy Fawkes preparing the attack.

Subjected to torture, he confessed the names of the conspirators, many of whom were executed for treason in the very place they intended to destroy. On January 31, 1606, the English government sold tickets for the execution of the traitors. All were hanged, castrated, burned alive, eviscerated and beheaded.

This grim episode went down in history as a day of celebration in England, remembering the execution of traitors and recreating Guy Fawkes in a mask.

Were it not for Alan Moore's adaptation in "V for Vendetta," Guy Fawkes might have been relegated to the original story. The graphic novel is set in an England devastated by a nuclear war, now under a fascist government. Against this regime arises the image of an anarchist avenger, taking up the anti-totalitarian representation of Guy Fawkes and his mask, leaving aside the religious connotations.

The film seeks to capture the plot of the graphic novel, although Alan Moore himself did not agree with certain aspects of the script, demanding that his name be removed from the credits. In contrast, illustrator David Lloyd supported the adaptation and appears in the credits.

The mask that many protesters wear has become a symbol of struggle against what they consider an oppressive state. Today, an activist group has emerged as an internet phenomenon: a virtual community with a voluntary goal of hacktivism as a form of protest.
