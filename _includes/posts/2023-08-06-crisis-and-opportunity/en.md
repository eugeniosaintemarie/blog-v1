In the Chinese culture, the words <i>"crisis"</i> 危机 (wēijī) and <i>"opportunity"</i> 机会 (jīhuì), can also be expressed together as a concept called <b>危机与机会</b> (wēijī yǔ jīhuì) (the interpretation of this concept varies and has been debated among linguists).

The character "危" (wēi) in "危机" (wēijī) does indeed mean "danger", but the character "机" (jī) in "机会" (jīhuì) means "opportunity". The combination of the two characters is often used to emphasize the idea that crisis can also contain elements of opportunity or potential for positive change.
