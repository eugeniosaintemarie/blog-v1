In the Chinese culture, the words <i>crisis</i> 危机 (wēijī) and <i>opportunity</i> 机会 (jīhuì), can also be expressed together as a concept called <b>危机与机会</b> (wēijī yǔ jīhuì) (the interpretation of this concept varies and has been debated among linguists).

The character 危 (wēi) in 危机 (wēijī) does mean danger, and the character 机 (jī) in 机会 (jīhuì) means opportunity.

The combination of the two characters is used to emphasize the idea that crisis can also contain elements of opportunity or potential for positive change.
