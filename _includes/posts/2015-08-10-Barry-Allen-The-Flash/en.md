>Created by Robert Kanigher and Carmine Infantino, he made his debut in Showcase #4 in October 1956. As a founding member of the Justice League and the current speedster of the DC Comics Universe, he is one of the publisher's most prominent characters. He has played a crucial role in numerous crises and key moments in the company's history and trajectory.

### Beginnings
Barry Allen and his twin brother were born a week or two late in the small Midwestern town of Fallville, Iowa. Their parents, Henry and Nora Allen, gave birth to the twins. However, due to a mix-up, Barry's brother was pronounced dead by Dr. Gilmore. In reality, the baby was healthy and was given to another family, the Thawne's, who had suffered the loss of their own child during childbirth.

Barry's late birth contributed to the development in him of a habit of being late everywhere. During his childhood, he found solace in the pages of the adventures of his favorite superhero, Jay Garrick, the original Flash. His passion for these stories was such that he used to recreate them with his friend Daphne Dean.

One day, when he was still a child, on his way home from school, Barry suffered a tragedy. His mother was murdered and his father was sentenced to prison for a crime he did not commit. This experience deeply scarred Barry and drove him to seek truth and justice to prove his father's innocence.

At a very young age, he took a liking to chemistry, which would later help him become a farmer, later winning first place in the Fallville County Fair Agricultural Competition. This achievement also earned him a college scholarship to Sun City, where he graduated in three years with a major in organic chemistry and a minor in criminology.

Growing up, Barry helped apprehend a bank robber, and then was offered a job as a police scientist with the Central City Police Detective Science Department. Barry accepted the offer since his new home was next door to Keystone City, where his childhood hero, Jay Garrick, lived. After moving in and getting an apartment that had a lab in the back, he began dating Iris West, a reporter for the Picture Newspaper. They met when Barry was examining a murder she was covering for the paper. Iris was attracted to Barry's honesty and stability.

That same night, a storm broke out while Barry was in his lab. Lightning flashed through the glass, sending Barry crashing into a table full of chemicals, showering him with various substances.

Disoriented and not fully understanding what had happened, Barry took a cab back to his apartment. As the cab began to pull away, Barry ran to catch up, at which point he noticed that everything around him slowed down, as if the cab had stopped. Surprised by this experience, Barry went to a restaurant, where, due to his newfound speed, he managed to keep his order from falling to the ground.

The next day, Barry saved Iris from being hit by a stray bullet, confirming that he had gained super human speed. Determined to use his new powers to help humanity, he designed a special suit and created a method to shrink it using a molten polyester and a hydrogen charge. He dubbed himself the Flash as an homage to his childhood hero, Jay Garrick. Although he initially considered not wearing a mask to emulate Jay, he eventually opted to wear one to protect his identity. With his new costume and determination, Barry faced his first adversary, the Turtle Man.

Having become an established hero, Barry co-founded the Justice League of America along with other heroes. During this time, he befriended Hal Jordan, known as the Green Lantern, and participated in numerous adventures in and out of the League. Later, Barry discovered that his childhood hero, Jay Garrick, was real and they became friends. Their ability to travel through time, thanks to their speed, allowed them to share experiences.

### Kid Flash
During one summer, Iris' nephew Wally West, a Flash fan, visited Central City.Knowing that Barry was a friend of the speedster, Wally arranged for them to meet.Barry shared with Wally how he got his powers and the boy was left wishing something similar could happen to him someday.In a curious way, Barry had placed a first aid kit with chemicals on site. That same afternoon, a storm drenched the city, and the same accident that gave Barry his speed happened to Wally, covering him with electrically charged chemicals.

With powers similar to the Flash's, Wally created a suit similar to Barry's, though smaller. The Picture Journal nicknamed him Kid Flash.

Later, Wally adopted a yellow and red suit, similar to the one Barry previously wore, and became Kid Flash, nephew of Barry's girlfriend Iris. Barry's relationship with Iris continued to develop, and he eventually proposed to her. Although Barry hid his identity for some time, he finally revealed his secret to Iris, who had already dreamed it on their honeymoon.

### Iris
There were times of concern in Barry's life, such as when he appeared to become infertile after an accident. However, later investigations revealed that he could still have children. In the midst of these experiences, Barry confronted his nemesis, Professor Zoom (Reverse Flash).
Shortly thereafter, Professor Zoom claimed Iris' life at a costume party. However, Barry caught up with him in a time stream and left him trapped there.
![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/in-post/2015-08-10-Barry-Allen-The-Flash/2015-08-10-Barry-Allen-The-Flash-7.jpg)
Eventually, Barry met another woman, Fiona Webb, and they began dating. However, on the day they planned to marry, Professor Zoom reappeared, threatening to kill all the women Barry loved. This led Barry to chase him on a journey around the world, forcing him to give up on his second attempt at marriage. Eventually, Zoom almost kills Fiona, but inadvertently, Barry manages to eliminate Zoom. However, this action led Barry to face a lengthy trial, where he was charged with murder.

Throughout his adventures, Barry suffered injuries, such as facial disfigurement after confronting Big Sir. This injury led him to Gorilla City, where his face was reconstructed. Since Barry was believed to be lost, he opted to change his appearance to protect his long-gone secret identity.

At another point, Barry was taken to the 30th century, where he was reunited with Iris, who had been resurrected. Taking advantage of technological advances, Barry restored her face through surgery. During this time, they lived in harmony and had two children, Don and Dawn. Barry also encountered Wally during a battle against Professor Zoom in the future. Barry managed to send his enemy into an alternate reality, although Zoom's exact fate was left in doubt.

### Death
The "Crisis on Infinite Earths" forced Barry's return to the 20th century, when the 30th century was collapsing. Natural disasters were unleashed despite advanced technology. Barry warned his fellow soldiers, but was trapped by the Anti-Monitor and taken to an antimatter universe. Barry faced torture from the Psycho-Pirate, but finally managed to use it to revolt the Anti-Monitor's servants. Barry destroyed the Anti-Monitor's antimatter cannon and aged rapidly due to his speed, thus entering the Speed Force, an energy dimension that is the power source of speedsters in the DC Universe.

The Speed Force is an essential concept within the DC Universe, an extradimensional energy force that acts as a source of power for all the Flash, including their counterparts and alternate versions. It is the primordial essence underlying the extraordinary speed of these characters. However, it is important to note that not all speedsters are linked to the Speed Force, as this special connection is reserved for those superhuman beings whose primary power is speed. As a result, figures such as Superman and Green Lantern, although possessing speed, do not have a direct relationship with this energetic entity.


There are different versions of what happened to Barry after his death. It has been shown that he turned into electricity and traveled through time, which led him to become a beam of light that struck him, giving him his powers. There is also talk of an extradimensional character with amnesia who eventually remembers his name and adopts the identity of Fastforward.

In the "Terminal Velocity" story, the notion of the Speed Force is reintroduced, depicted as a sort of Valhalla for speedsters, a majestic hall similar to that found in Asgard, the realm of Odin. In this depiction, Barry joins the legion of super speedsters who have passed away over time. This allows Barry to once again become a lightning bolt that strikes him during a chemical accident.

### Return
During the "Infinite Crisis," Barry's soul is seen in the Speed Force alongside Johnny Quick and Max Mercury. They are there to help his grandson Bart in his fight against Superboy-Prime. In addition, Barry is part of an effort to bring many villains into the Speed Force.
![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/in-post/2015-08-10-Barry-Allen-The-Flash/2015-08-10-Barry-Allen-The-Flash-10.jpg)

Bart Allen later emerges from the Speed Force wearing Barry's costume in Tokyo. He warns the other heroes that Superboy-Prime has escaped. Once again, Bart confronts Superboy-Prime. Barry spends four years in an alternate Keystone City alongside Johnny Quick, Max Mercury and an alternate version of Jay Garrick. He then teams up with Bart and Wally West to defeat Superboy-Prime. When the enemy escapes again, Barry suggests that one of the speedsters absorb all of the Speed Force and cross the dimensional bridge to Post-Crisis Earth. Bart volunteers and Barry gives him his suit as a final gift, retaining the Speed Force in himself.

During "Final Crisis," Barry reappears chasing a stray bullet through time that kills Orion. He is pursued by Black Racer and what appears to be the Morticoccus Virus. Upon encountering Wally and Jay, he urges them to run and together they speed through time, only to discover that Darkseid has conquered the world. After evading the Furies, Barry manages to break the Anti-Life's influence over Iris by kissing her. Then, along with Jay, he develops a plan to confront Darkseid and Black Racer. Despite his doubts, Barry accepts Wally's help and the two confront the threat. Using their speed, they manage to hit Darkseid with his own Omega Beams, allowing Black Racer to eliminate him.

Soon after, Barry manages to escape from the Speed Force. Although his friends and family are pleased with his return, Barry is uneasy about his escape, as others like Max Mercury and Johnny Quick are still trapped there. Determined not to waste this second chance, Barry catches up with what he missed at the Flash Museum. There he is reunited with his old friend Hal Jordan, who has also died and been resurrected. Barry confides in Hal his discomfort at his return and his wish he hadn't come back. Barry asks Hal to tell Wally and Jay that he won't be attending the festivities in their honor and runs off to patrol.

While running, Barry encounters Savitar, a speedster who has somehow also escaped from the Speed Force and has been following Barry. When he finally catches him, Savitar disintegrates before his eyes. Later, Barry and Wally discover the Black Flash, who was supposedly dead. However, Barry eventually becomes the Black Flash... Realizing that his presence could hurt or even kill innocents, Barry decides to return to the Speed Force. There he is reunited with his friends Max Mercury and Johnny Quick. Max tries to convince Barry that he is not guilty of becoming the Black Flash. However, they are confronted by Professor Zoom, who reveals his plan to go back in time and manipulate Barry's subconscious during the "Final Crisis".

Zoom creates the Negative Speed Force to corrupt Barry and other speedsters. Before Barry can confront Zoom, he disappears. Wally enters the Speed Force to rescue his uncle, while Max reveals that Barry unknowingly created the source of all speedsters' power. Meanwhile, Wally, Max and Johnny manage to escape from the Speed Force. The speedsters fight Zoom, who despite being outnumbered, manages to escape with Barry. Zoom reveals that he is the cause of all the tragedies in Barry's life, including the death of his mother. Determined to destroy everything, Zoom plans to kill Iris before she meets Barry. Barry and Wally chase Zoom, and using their speed, manage to stop him from killing Iris. The two Flash chase Zoom into the "Final Crisis," turning into a beam of light that strikes Barry and Wally, allowing them to stop Zoom and purify the Speed Force.

Finally, the threat dissipates and everyone celebrates the return of Barry and the other speedsters. Barry closes the case of his mother's death and resumes his other cases. He spends time with Iris and then joins the Justice League in Washington D.C. to celebrate his return.

A few months later, at Bruce Wayne's grave, Barry and Hal Jordan reflect on Batman's death and how heroes begin to associate him with Wayne. They discuss their own deaths, commenting on the sadness Barry's death caused and the anger in Hal's case. Barry concludes by saying, "I died a sinner, and you died a saint." As they leave the cemetery, Barry expresses his wish that his companions may return someday. In particular, he mentions to Batman, "If there is an escape, you can bet Batman already has it planned."

During a confrontation with the Black Lantern, J'onn J'onzz, Barry found a mysterious black residue in Bruce Wayne's grave. This substance, similar to blood clotting, began to corrupt part of his skin and muscles during his battle with his old friend, who was trying to kill him along with Hal. According to the Black Lanterns, those who had already died, like Barry and Hal, had to return to that state to maintain balance in the universe.

After confronting Martian in his half-dead state and other Black Lanterns along with Hal, Atom, Firestorm, Mera and two members of the Indigo Tribe, Barry, Wally and Bart race around the world to alert all the heroes about the situation. They even try to warn the Rogues, who anticipate that their fallen comrades will seek them out. The Rogues first attack Iron Heights Penitentiary, unaware that Sam Scudder, the original Mirror Master, is now a Black Lantern and is watching them. Meanwhile, Flash faces the Black Lantern version of Professor Zoom in a brief battle.

Barry decides to head to Gorilla City to meet Solovar, but learns that Solovar had died years ago and is now a Black Lantern. After confronting Grodd, who has attacked Gorilla City, Barry heads to Coast City.

After stopping Grodd at the city monument, he witnesses the arrival of Nekron, leader of the Black Lanterns, along with Scar and Black Hand. The Justice League, the Titans, Wally and Bart arrive to confront Nekron. However, Nekron reveals that all the fallen heroes are linked to him and uses rings to turn heroes like Superman, Green Arrow and Bart into Black Lanterns. Barry is also haunted by a black ring and is forced to run to avoid joining the ranks of the Black Lanterns. In an attempt to find a balance, Barry is cast as the Blue Lantern for 24 hours.

During the fight, Barry is forced to confront his own grandson, whose ring detects that he is alive but will die if he doesn't free himself from the black ring soon. Barry uses creative abilities with the ring, creating images of Bart as Impulse and Kid Flash to try to make him react. Though their plan is interrupted, Barry, Wally and Walker confront Professor Zoom Black Lantern and Solovar.

Barry and Hal search for Prometheus in Prometheus Country, who escaped after destroying Star City. After talking to Shade, they discover that Oliver helped destroy Prometheus, and later Green Arrow killed him. After confronting Oliver about this, Barry promises that he and the League will find Oliver before he kills again.

With the help of Dinah and Hal, Barry searches for Oliver in the latter's city. He confronts Connor Hawke and reveals to him the crime committed by his father. Finally, the trio confronts Oliver, and Barry tells him that he hates him more and more every time he sees him. Barry tries to catch Oliver, but Oliver electrocutes Barry with a trap.

Barry resumes his life in Central City, appearing to have been in witness protection. He returns to the Police Department's crime lab and goes back to patrolling the streets as the Flash. In the midst of this, he encounters an individual dressed as the Mirror Master, who is instantly killed on the streets. Barry investigates the crime scene and learns of another portal, donning his Flash suit and rushing to the scene. There, he confronts The Renegades, a 25th century group that arrests him for the murder of Mirror Monarch. Barry claims he hasn't killed anyone, but Commander Cold of The Renegades warns him that he will.

After a brief fight, The Renegades retreat, accidentally destroying a building. Barry saves the inhabitants and rebuilds the building in minutes. He then confronts The Renegades again, this time accompanied by Captain Boomerang with explosive energy boomerangs. In the middle of the fight, Top, a member of The Renegades, questions whether Flash is really guilty, since in his timeline Boomerang never appeared.

The Rogues show up with a giant mirror left behind by the Mirror Master.
![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/in-post/2015-08-10-Barry-Allen-The-Flash/2015-08-10-Barry-Allen-The-Flash-15.jpg)
A fight breaks out between the two groups. Top confesses to Barry that the cause of Mirror Monarch's death was the death of Iris. Barry tries to stop the breaking of the mirror while Top protects Iris. However, Captain Boomerang launches a boomerang towards the mirror, breaking it and freeing the Mirror Masters. The Renegades capture Barry, who is taken to the 25th century. Top confronts Iris.

Barry manages to escape the court and the 25th century to find Top. Top reveals to him that his crimes were due to the Flash reopening one of his cases. Barry believes Top is innocent and is released. However, the real culprit turns out to be an ancestor of Top's, who explains that The Renegades do not accept members with criminal ancestors. Barry defeats Top and locks up the real culprit, freeing the innocent one. The Renegades return to the 25th century and acknowledge the error in their records.

One morning, Barry is late for work due to a fight with Gorilla Grodd at the zoo. Then, he is sent to investigate a possible homicide involving Elastic Boy. Although the prints and costume match Elastic Boy, the body belongs to an older man. This investigation causes Barry to miss a family picnic.

That night, Barry contacts his colleague Patty Spivot to get help on the case. However, her lab is attacked by the mysterious Hot Pursuit. Barry turns into the Flash and chases Hot Pursuit into the river. Hot Pursuit, who turns out to be an alternate version of Barry, explains that he comes from New Earth to investigate anomalies that would affect alternate realities. Kid Flash then appears, who talks to Barry about his absence at the field day. Hot Pursuit shows interest in Bart and his connection to the Speed Force. Despite Barry's offer of help, Hot Pursuit decides to go solo. Hot Pursuit's Cosmic Motorcycle falls into the Speed Force, and Bart runs after it, believing Barry is following him. However, Bart realizes that Barry was absent at the picnic because of him and races away.

Barry returns to his lab and discovers that Hot Pursuit is actually himself. Patty reveals to him that she cannot be involved in the case due to her lack of connection to the crime lab. After receiving a message from Iris, Barry rushes home, where his entire family is waiting for him. They discuss his absence and the importance of living his life. Bart wonders why Barry can't be a person he respects and admires, and runs off. Barry chases after him, but Hot Pursuit catches Bart.

Barry manages to rescue Bart from the clutches of Hot Pursuit, who reveals himself to be a future version of Barry. Hot Pursuit seeks to return Bart to the future, as his existence is an anomaly. Barry and Hot Pursuit fight, and the latter detects a current anomaly that leads him to run in pursuit, followed by Flash and Kid Flash. The anomaly turns out to be Professor Zoom, who attacks Patty. Flash saves her, and then fights Zoom. Hot Pursuit uses his staff to take the Speed Force away from Zoom. Flash and Kid Flash evacuate the area when Hot Pursuit warns that everything within 100 feet will age to dust. Zoom escapes Hot Pursuit's attack and kills Hot Pursuit. Flash and Kid Flash pursue Zoom, but lose sight of him.

Barry reveals to Kid Flash that Zoom killed his mother and they both head to the police department. Barry visits Patty and she reveals that she was in love with him when she was his assistant. However, he decides to take a step back while his mother's murder case is unsolved. Barry becomes more open and confesses his love for Iris.

Barry wakes up in a world he doesn't recognize. He discovers that this new world is an alternate outcome due to an event in the past. In this reality, Aquaman and Wonder Woman are at war, which has led to a global catastrophe. In addition, Superman is held in a laboratory and Gotham City is in ruins, being ruled by an extremely violent Batman.
