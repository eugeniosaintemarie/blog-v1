        Take me home, lonely road\\
        \\
        I'ma go downtown\\
        Ain't been in a long time\\
        I'm takin' back Sundays\\
        Since you took away my life (since you took away my life)\\
        There's some things that I know now (mmh)\\
        Couple songs that I'd rewrite (yeah)\\
        Start over like Mondays\\
        Pourin' strong on a weeknight (mmh)\\
        \\
        See, I hear the devil wears Prada, but I couldn't read the tags\\
        And your horns started showin' when I seen you mad\\
        But I'll wait for you 'cause this is not the face I knew\\
        I probably could've saved us, but instead, I let us crash\\
        'Cause I don't trust no one to love me back, but she say, 'I do'\\
        And this is not the place for you\\
        \\
        Lonely road, take me home\\
        To the place that we went wrong\\
        Where'd you go now?\\
        It's been a ghost town\\
        And I'm still here all alone\\
        \\
        When the days feel long and the nights get cold\\
        And I'm thousands of miles away (ah-ah-ah)\\
        I use alcohol just to fill that hole\\
        Will our home ever be the same?\\
        \\
        I hear the devil wears Prada, but I couldn't read the tags\\
        And your horn started showin' when I see you mad\\
        But I'll wait for you 'cause this is not the face I knew\\
        And I probably could've saved us, but instead, I let us crash\\
        'Cause I don't trust no one to love me back, but you say, 'I do'\\
        And this is not the place for you\\
        \\
        Lonely road, take me home\\
        To the place that we went wrong\\
        Where'd you go now?\\
        It's been a ghost town\\
        And I'm still here all alone\\
        \\
        And if you could salvage my soul\\
        Would you sacrifice this life to not die alone?\\
        'Cause even a palace ain't home without you\\
        So I might leave here soon, but I wanna leave you this song (hey)\\
        \\
        Lonely road (lonely road)\\
        Take me home (won't you take me home?)\\
        To the place that we went wrong\\
        Where'd you go now? (Where'd you go now?)\\
        It's been a ghost town\\
        And I'm still here all alone (I'm still here)\\
        \\
        Yeah, I'm on this road now (this lonely road)\\
        Feeling so alone\\
        Take me home (this lonely road)\\
        Mm, I'm on this road now (this lonely road)\\
        Feeling so alone\\
        Take me home, mm" | markdownify }}
